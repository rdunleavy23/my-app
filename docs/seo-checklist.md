# Pattern Growth – SEO Enhancement Checklist

## Page fundamentals
- One H1. Descriptive, keyword-bearing.
- Clear H2/H3 hierarchy. No skipped levels.
- Meta title (≤60 chars) + description (≤155 chars) reflect page intent.
- Open Graph: title/description/image set.
- Canonical URL set implicitly by app router route.

## Copy & intent
- First 100–150 words state value and target terms naturally.
- Replace vague verbs with concrete outcomes.
- Avoid jargon; front-load benefits.

## Keywords (lightweight)
- Primary phrase in H1 and early body.
- 2–3 secondary variations in H2/H3 and body.
- No stuffing. Read aloud test passes.

## Links & media
- Internal links to 2–3 relevant pages/sections.
- Descriptive link anchors.
- Images: meaningful `alt` text; filenames ≈ topic.

## Technical
- Only one H1.
- No raw `>` in JSX; escape as `&gt;`.
- Fast above-the-fold content (no heavy embeds).
- Sitemap includes live routes only.
- JSON-LD where helpful (Organization, BlogPosting).

## Measure
- Verify title/description in page source.
- Lighthouse: SEO ≥ 90, Accessibility ≥ 90.
- Analytics events fire on key CTAs.
